## Important Note for Reviewers

This repository is a **representative sample**, not an exhaustive record of my experience.

If you’re reviewing this as a recruiter, hiring manager, or collaborator:

* Use it to understand **how I work and think**
* Not as a complete measure of scope, scale, or complexity of my past roles

I’m always happy to discuss deeper technical work or real-world systems **verbally or under appropriate confidentiality**.
